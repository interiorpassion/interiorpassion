### Hello! Happy you're here!  ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**interiorpassion/interiorpassion** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


-->I have been the director of my own interior design and architectural and graphics firm in Bangkok for nearly 20 years. I went to college for Computers Science, but ended up in design instead. Since the COVID19 Spread business has slowed quite a bit in the building industry here in Bangkok,  so I desided to go back to my roots at age 59. Yes, to many of you I am old, but to me life is just beginning with each new day. Besides, an idle mind dies a quick death and become useless. I prefer to keep it running the best I can each day. If you don't mind me being older than you, then I don't mind you being younger than me. I rather see you for who, and what you are. âœŒ Peace!

 âš¡ Fun fact: ...I get bored easily. Always have, so I have to keep my mind busy with new challenges. I am American, but have lived abroad in Thailand for slightly over 20 years now.
